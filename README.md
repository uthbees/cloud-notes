## Overview

**Project Title**: Cloud notes API

**Project Description**: An API for a cloud notes application

**Project Goals**: The goal of this sprint is to create an API that I can build one or more frontends for in future sprints. The goal of the overall project is to provide a platform for saving notes on the cloud with a better UI than other platforms I've tried.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uthbees/cloud-notes.git
```

2. Install the project dependencies (run in the project directory):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
4. Make sure the mysql service is running (differs per OS): https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+tell+if+mysql+is+running
5. Using [mysql workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or the command line, initialize the database by running the server/init-db.sql file.
6. Create a .env file in the root directory, referencing .env.example for directions on what to include.
7. In separate terminals, run `npm run server` and `npm run api-spec` (both in the project directory). A page should open in your browser.

Instructions for using the software:

This is just an API for now, so all I have for a frontend is the Swagger UI API specification page. It should still work though - you can query the API endpoints under the "in scope" section using the "try it out" buttons.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

If you have it set up to run, you have it set up to develop. (What's the point of this section??)
